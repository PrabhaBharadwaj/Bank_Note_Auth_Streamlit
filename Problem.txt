Bank Note Authentication Problem:

https://github.com/krishnaik06/Dockers

To Understand Docker and Strealit, i have downloaded already built project folder from Krish naik Github
So actual python code is MOdelTraining.ipynb. I have Krish already created classifier.pkl file, app.py , requirement.txt , (templates, static not req)
Just i did deployment by syncing this in my github

Approach:

By using Linear RandomForset Regressor , we are predicting the JBank Note Authentication based on user input data as 0 or 1

Here we used Streamlit web application Framework and deployed in Heroku(PlatformAs A service-PAAS) using gIThUB.


Here main files are :
		app.py
		model.pkl
		requirements.txt
		Procfile
